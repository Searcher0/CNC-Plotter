This project is a customized version of the CNC Plotter by mith on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4796222

Recreated the plotter components in Fusion360 because I only have the hobby license and the number of facets to delete was too much, so I made my own by referencing the design.

Changes made :

Increased the width of the main plates enough to fit a 35mm KP35FM2-035 bipolar stepper motor. Increased the width and pitch of the rack and pinion mechanism.
Used an Osepp motor and servo driver shield which is equivalent to the Adafruit motor and servo shield V1, Adafruit library works fine with it.
Printed with an Ender 3 V2 at 18% infill with the Cura slicer.
